One Time Pad

I had to run dos2unix to get compileall to work. I copied the compileall file back from os1
and then zipped it. I think you shouldnt have a problem running it but
just incase i wanted to give you a heads up. I also sent over my gradingscipt i got back, i hope 
it runs smoothly. thanks
